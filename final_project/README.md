NOTE: SERVICE REQUIRES PIP3 TO BE INSTALLED

IF NOT INSTALLED, CAN BE INSTALLED WITH: sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Directory Structure:
  ** path: /Parpkay/file_from_below **
    - requirements.txt - the required dependencies for the service
    - test_service.sh - the script that does the unit testing and produces the CODE COVERAGE results
    - start_server.sh - the script that REINITIALIZES the data_storage system and starts the Server API
    - src/ - all the source code
    - src/core/ - all the concrete classes
    - src/utlities - utilities functions for the concrete classes
      		   - these utilities act as interfaces (Python lacks interfaces)
    - src/init_data.py - the script that initializes the data storage system
    - src/test - contains the TA's test script (not the latest that he made on 11/13)
    - data_storage/ - contains all the serialized data_object files for each class

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. execute the script "install_service.sh" via- "./install_service.sh"

   - NOTE: the script is on the same level as this README.md file

   - By executing this script, we:
     	- extract the source code
     	- install all the required dependencies via pip3


START THE SERVER:
1. cd ParkPay/ (if not already there)
2. execute the script "start_server.sh" via "./start_server.sh"

   - NOTE: This will always reinitialize the data storage system
   if you just want to start the server without reinitializing the data storage system,
   do the following:

   - cd /src
   - python3 controller.py

   The only difference between this and start_server.sh is that start_server.sh reinitializes the data storage system


EXCUTE THE UNIT TEST AND VIEW CODE COVERAGE

1. cd ParkPay/ (if not there already)
2. execute the script "test_service.sh" via "./test_service.sh"

   - This will reinitialize the data storage system, and run the unit test code "service_test.py"
   - following this, a series of shell commands uses the coverage module to reports statistics of the code coverage



KNOWN BUGS:
this is actually a bug in the test data provided by the professor. Test case
 27 will fail because of how the test case is using a date format and not a date_and_time format. Also, the card number is generated by a RNG in my service.

The older test script (before the TA fixed the issue) is currently in src/test/ so the TA needs to add the newest copy of the test code
